/*Annual Compound Interest Rate Formula:
 * 
 * A = P ( 1 + r/n ) ^ nt
 * 
 * A = amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
 * P = principal amount (the initial amount you borrow or deposit)
 * r = annual rate of interest (as a decimal)
 * n = number of times the interest is compounded per year 
 * t = number of years the amount is deposited or borrowed for.
